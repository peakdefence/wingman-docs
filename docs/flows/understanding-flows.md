# Understanding Flows

This guide introduces the concept of flows in WINGMAN and how they can be used to automate security processes.

## What are Flows?

Flows are automated workflows that connect different parts of the WINGMAN platform to streamline security operations. They allow you to define a series of steps that execute automatically based on triggers or schedules.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Triggers

Events that start a flow:
- New vulnerability detected
- Asset status change
- Scheduled time
- Manual execution
- External webhook

### 2. Actions

Operations performed by the flow:
- Send notifications
- Create tickets
- Run scans
- Update records
- Execute scripts

### 3. Conditions

Logic that controls flow execution:
- If/Then/Else statements
- Data validation
- Rate limiting
- Error handling

## Flow Components

### 1. Inputs

Data that flows into the workflow:
- Event data
- User input
- API responses
- File uploads

### 2. Processing

Transformations and logic:
- Data enrichment
- Format conversion
- Calculations
- Decision points

### 3. Outputs

Results of the flow:
- Updated records
- Generated reports
- Sent notifications
- Created tickets

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Incident Response

1. Trigger: New high-severity alert
2. Actions:
   - Create incident ticket
   - Notify on-call team
   - Gather context
   - Run initial triage

### 2. Vulnerability Management

1. Trigger: New vulnerability scan results
2. Actions:
   - Triage vulnerabilities
   - Assign owners
   - Track remediation
   - Generate reports

### 3. Compliance Monitoring

1. Trigger: Scheduled check
2. Actions:
   - Verify controls
   - Document evidence
   - Generate compliance report
   - Notify stakeholders

## Best Practices

1. **Design**
   - Keep flows simple and focused
   - Document flow purpose and logic
   - Handle errors gracefully

2. **Implementation**
   - Test thoroughly before production
   - Monitor flow execution
   - Log important events

3. **Maintenance**
   - Review and update regularly
   - Archive unused flows
   - Document changes
