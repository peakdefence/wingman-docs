# Flow Execution

This guide explains how flows are executed in WINGMAN, including monitoring, troubleshooting, and best practices.

## Execution Modes

### 1. Automated Execution

Flows can run automatically based on:

- **Triggers**: Events that start a flow
- **Schedules**: Time-based execution
- **Webhooks**: External system calls

### 2. Manual Execution

Flows can be started manually by:

- Clicking **Run** in the UI
- Using the CLI
- Calling the execution API

## Monitoring Flow Execution

### Execution Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Automation** > **Executions**
2. View running and completed flows
3. Filter by status, date, or flow type

### Real-time Monitoring

- View active executions
- See progress of each step
- Monitor resource usage
- View execution logs

### Notifications

Configure alerts for:
- Flow failures
- Long-running flows
- Specific conditions

## Execution Details

### Flow Instance

Each execution creates a flow instance with:

- Unique ID
- Start/end times
- Status (running, completed, failed)
- Execution logs
- Input/output data

### Step Execution

Each step in the flow includes:

- Start/end times
- Status
- Input/output data
- Error details (if any)
- Performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Flow Not Starting

1. Check trigger configuration
2. Verify permissions
3. Check system logs
4. Verify dependencies

#### Flow Failing

1. Review execution logs
2. Check input data
3. Verify API connectivity
4. Review error messages

#### Performance Issues

1. Check system resources
2. Review flow design
3. Look for bottlenecks
4. Check for infinite loops

### Debugging Tools

#### Execution Logs

1. Navigate to the execution details
2. View step-by-step logs
3. Filter by log level
4. Download logs for analysis

#### Debug Mode

1. Enable debug mode for the flow
2. Rerun the flow
3. Review detailed logs
4. Disable debug mode when done

## Best Practices

### Before Execution

1. Test in development first
2. Review flow configuration
3. Check dependencies
4. Set up monitoring

### During Execution

1. Monitor progress
2. Watch for warnings
3. Be ready to intervene
4. Document issues

### After Execution

1. Review results
2. Verify outputs
3. Document findings
4. Update documentation

## Advanced Topics

### Error Handling

1. **Retry Logic**
   - Configure automatic retries
   - Set delay between retries
   - Limit number of retries

2. **Error Paths**
   - Define fallback actions
   - Handle specific error types
   - Notify on failure

### Performance Optimization

1. **Parallel Execution**
   - Run independent steps in parallel
   - Set concurrency limits
   - Manage shared resources

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Process items in batches
   - Set batch sizes
   - Handle partial failures

### Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Restrict who can execute flows
   - Follow least privilege
   - Audit execution history

2. **Data Protection**
   - Secure sensitive data
   - Mask sensitive fields in logs
   - Follow data retention policies

## Example: Debugging a Failed Flow

1. **Identify the Issue**
   - Check execution status
   - Review error message
   - Identify failed step

2. **Gather Information**
   - View execution logs
   - Check input data
   - Review step configuration

3. **Fix the Issue**
   - Update the flow
   - Test the fix
   - Deploy to production
