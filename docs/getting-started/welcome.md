# What is WINGMAN?

## The Security Assistant Every Organization Actually Needs

Picture the classic scenario: It's Tuesday afternoon, and security teams are drowning in vulnerability reports that may or may not be relevant to anything they actually own. Someone from Sales has forwarded their fourteenth security questionnaire this month. The risk register was last updated during what historians might generously call "the early days of the internet."

Meanwhile, the SIEM is generating alerts about something that's probably nothing, the GRC platform is demanding updates to policies that may no longer apply, and somewhere in the back of everyone's mind lurks the knowledge that there's a critical security control needing review—but nobody can remember which one or when.

This scenario plays out in organizations worldwide, with security professionals clutching their coffee while wondering how something as straightforward as "keeping things secure" became quite so wonderfully chaotic.

### The Three Uncomfortable Truths About Cybersecurity
Before we begin this journey together, let's establish some ground rules that your consultant probably won't tell you:

- **Truth #1**: Your Current Security Documentation is Fiction:
> Most organizations have security policies that read like aspirational poetry - beautiful in theory, completely divorced from reality. WINGMAN's first job is to help you create documentation that reflects what you actually do, not what you tell auditors you do after a particularly good lunch.

- **Truth #2**: Generic Templates are Security Theatre:
> That ISO 27001 template you downloaded? About as useful as a chocolate firewall. WINGMAN builds context-specific security that actually fits your organization, like a bespoke suit rather than something grabbed off the rack at Security Templates R Us.

- **Truth #3**: You Can't Manage What You Don't Understand:
> Most security tools assume you have a PhD in acronyms and infinite time. WINGMAN assumes you're human, overwhelmed, and would rather be doing literally anything else. We'll get you from "what's an asset?" to "mature security posture" without the usual descent into madness.

Enter WINGMAN: the AI-driven virtual security office assistant that addresses these exact challenges.

## What Makes WINGMAN Different from Traditional Approaches

### It Doesn't Suffer from "Shiny New Tool Syndrome"

Many organizations have fallen for the security platform that promises to solve every problem known to humanity. Six months later, teams are still trying to convince it to communicate with literally anything else in their environment.

WINGMAN takes a refreshingly different approach. Instead of trying to be everything to everyone, it plays the role of diplomatic translator. Existing SIEMs can continue their mysterious operations, GRC platforms can keep doing whatever GRC platforms do, and WINGMAN simply ensures they're all speaking the same language.

It's rather like hosting a dinner party where everyone actually gets along—a revolutionary concept in the security tools ecosystem.

### The "Live Security Context" Innovation

WINGMAN maintains what the developers call "Live Security Context." Think of it as one of those detective show conspiracy boards—with photos and red string connecting everything—except infinitely more organized and significantly less concerning to visitors.

WINGMAN understands that Vulnerability A affects Asset B, which is protected by Control C, which was last reviewed during Audit D, and there's a task to update it that's been languishing in someone's queue since time immemorial.

The "live" aspect means these connections stay current. When something changes—a new vulnerability appears, an asset is decommissioned, or someone actually completes a task—WINGMAN updates all related connections without requiring manual intervention.

Because manual updates are where good security intentions typically go to die.

## What WINGMAN Actually Does

### Comprehensive Information Management

WINGMAN maintains what are called "nodes"—essentially, all the critical security components:

- **Security Requirements** (including those buried in 347-page compliance documents)
- **Controls** (the mechanisms designed to maintain security)
- **Assets** (everything requiring protection, including forgotten servers)
- **Risks** (out attempts to predict what might go wrong in order to prevent it)
- **Tasks** (the ever-growing mountain of security actions)
- **Incidents** (the learning experiences where we have failed to predict what might go wrong or have failed to implement defences (controls) successfully)
- **Vulnerabilities** (features of assets which make them vulnerable)
- **Threat reports** (indications of something potentially going wrong )
- **Audits and Findings** (formal documentation of past checks)

The key differentiator: WINGMAN doesn't just store this information like a digital filing cabinet—it understands how everything interconnects.

### Intelligent Prioritization and Context

Teams often struggle to explain why a "low priority" vulnerability suddenly became urgent, or which of 847 security tasks should receive immediate attention.

WINGMAN addresses this by:

- **Prioritizing intelligently**: Considering actual relationships and impact rather than arbitrary severity scores
- **Providing context**: When incidents occur, showing what else might be affected
- **Suggesting actions**: Based on the organization's specific situation rather than generic internet advice

### Natural Language Interface

WINGMAN includes chat functionality (available through web interface or MCP connection to existing LLM chat apps), allowing users to ask practical questions such as:
- "What assets are affected by this new vulnerability?"
- "Show me all high-risk items without assigned owners"
- "What has changed since our last board meeting?"

For teams preferring external AI assistants like Claude or ChatGPT, WINGMAN integrates through MCP (Model Context Protocol). This gives AI assistants access to the organization's actual security context, enabling relevant, situation-specific advice rather than generic recommendations.

## The Underlying Philosophy

WINGMAN is built on the principle that effective security isn't about having the most expensive tools or comprehensive policies—it's about achieving balance.

Specifically, balancing:
- **People** (the humans making critical decisions)
- **Process** (structured approaches to getting work done) in our case we use *Flow* definition
- **Technology** (tools that support rather than complicate operations)

Most security programs lean heavily toward one area and wonder why incidents still occur. WINGMAN helps organizations find the optimal balance where all three elements work together rather than against each other.

## Integration Approach

Rather than demanding organizations replace existing systems, WINGMAN integrates with current infrastructure:
- **Communication platforms** (Slack, Microsoft Teams)
- **Security tools** (SIEMs, vulnerability scanners)
- **Business systems** (Jira, GRC platforms)
- **AI assistants** (Claude, ChatGPT, custom solutions)

This integration strategy means teams can enhance their current workflows rather than completely rebuilding them.

## The Value Proposition

WINGMAN serves as an organization's security memory and intelligence system. It remembers what teams have forgotten, connects previously invisible dots, and helps focus attention on genuinely important issues rather than just the loudest alerts.

It's equivalent to having that impossibly organized colleague who tracks everything, anticipates problems before they become disasters, and never gets overwhelmed by the constant stream of security alerts and requirements.

The difference: this colleague works continuously, doesn't require coffee breaks, and won't judge anyone for asking the same question multiple times.

## What WINGMAN is NOT

To set proper expectations, it's important to understand what WINGMAN is not:

- ❌ **Not a SIEM**: While WINGMAN can integrate with SIEM solutions, it's not a replacement for them
- ❌ **Not a Vulnerability Scanner**: WINGMAN helps manage vulnerabilities but doesn't perform scans
- ❌ **Not a GRC Platform**: While there's overlap, WINGMAN focuses on security context and relationships
- ❌ **Not a Ticketing System**: WINGMAN can track tasks but isn't designed as a full ITSM solution
