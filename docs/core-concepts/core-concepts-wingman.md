## Suggestions

WINGMAN is an "assistant"! As such it doesn't make decisions for you, instead it collects the information, analyzes it and then proposes a court of action a "Human in the loop" has to approve. In order to do this as part of *Flows* WINGMAN will produce Suggestions. The suggestions are of following type:

| Suggestion type | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Node metadata update | - Updating risk description to make it better <br> - Updating asset description |
| Node relationship update | - Creating links between a risk and a number of assets <br> - Creating a link between a Task and Control |
| Node create / update | - Creating a new task for treating the risk / implementing new control or improving existing  control|
